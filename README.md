# rust_directory_structure

This is my work-in-progress directory
structure for making a new Rust project.

I'm happy with where it is right now,
but I've only got a couple of weeks
working with Rust under my belt so
I expect there will be changes as I
learn more.

The `src` directory shows and tests
all the features. The `_template` 
directory is what I copy out of
to make new projects.
